          Increasing Dissolved Impurities
        </div>
        <div style="padding-top: 10px;">
        Impurities, especially Dissolved ones are increasing in potable Water whether
        supplied by municipalities or from Ground well.
        <div style="padding-top: 10px;">
        Contamination of Groundwater: The underground water has pesticides,
        insecticides, and harmful chemicals such as arsenic,
        <div style="padding-top: 10px;">
        fluoride & lead.
        Pesticides & Chemicals in River Water: Excessive use of pesticides
        as well as contamination from industrial
        <div style="padding-top: 10px;">
        waste affects river water. These soluble
        chemicals result
        in water borne diseases.
        Rusting of Pipes: The water from municipalities
        <div style="padding-top: 10px;"></div>
        goes to overhead tank from where it travels through
        rusted old pipelines, which are also often unclean, causing further water contamination.
        <div style="padding-top: 10px;"></div>
        Hence, it is essential to purify water before you drink.
        For this reason, KENTâ€™s domestic RO water purifiers are ideal as they not
        only kill bacteria
        <div style="padding-top: 10px;"></div> and viruses but also remove harmful dissolved impurities
        from water, making it 100% pure.
