          Rusting of Pipes: The water from municipalities goes to

          Hence, it is essential to purify water before you drink.
          For this reason, KENTâ€™s domestic RO water purifiers are ideal as
          they not only kill bacteria and viruses but also remove harmful
          dissolved impurities from water, making it 100% pure.
